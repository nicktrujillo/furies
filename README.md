# Millody.

Millody is a social networking app for up-and-coming musicians that provides various tools for career growth. Our mission is to create a culture of mutual support between amateur artists/producers and help them advance their careers by providing a platform that encourages networking and collaboration. We also provide paid services such as audio mixing/mastering and music promotion. 

This app was built with the MERN technology stack. Node and Express are used for the backend server, React is used for the frontend with Redux to manage the state. Socket.io is used to allow for real-time direct messaging within the app. The SoundCloud and YouTube APIs are used to allow users to post their music, and the Cloudinary API is used to allow users to upload custom profile avatars. Furthermore, it is integrated with PayPal Checkout to process customer payments for the services that Millody provides. All of the data is stored in MongoDB Atlas.
